# Project 3 ASIR

This repository was the final project on my studies. It runs an NGINX, DNS and mySQL services to create a full werbhosting service on docker with a few clients to test it.

## To initialize everything use this command:

  -docker-compose up --build
 
## To turn off everything√ë

  -CTRL + C (use this in the same terminal as the first command)
  
  -docker-compose down (same as the last command)
